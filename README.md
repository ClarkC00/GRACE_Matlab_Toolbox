GRACE_Matlab_Toolbox
GRACE Matlab Toolbox (GRAMAT) contains a set of open-source functions to process GRACE level-2 spherical harmonic coefficient products. Data processing functions in the GMT contain: (1) destriping of SH coefficients to remove “north-to-south” stripes and Gaussian smoothing, (2) spherical harmonic analysis and synthesis, (3) analyzing and reducing leakage effect in GRACE-derived mass variations, (4) analyzing regional mass variations in spatial and temporal domains. Matlab GUIs are presented to facilitate the use of functions in the GRAMAT.
